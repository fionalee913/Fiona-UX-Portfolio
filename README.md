## Research
### Understanding the Space of Cognitive Psychology Tasks
Research study that investigated how psychology professionals perceived the similarities and difference among cognitive psychology assessments. The study leveraged an open call to create a sorting experiment and collect perceived similarity data. The similarity data was later transformed into quantitative values, and constructed a space of cognitive psychology tasks, in which tasks with higher similarities were clustered together.

Research study that explored Asian Americans' racial and ethnic identity development, as well as their experience of discrimination during COVID-19. The study was conducted through semi-constructed interviews to collect qualitative data across life span. The data is now being transcribed and coded for analysis stage.
